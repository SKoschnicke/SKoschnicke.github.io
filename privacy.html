<p>
This website is operated by me, Sven Koschnicke, and I am responsible in terms
of data protection rights (see my full address on the <a href="/about">about page</a>).
</p>

<p>
When using this website, no personal information about you is stored by me.
</p>

<p>
When your browser-software requests a part of this website, it sends some
request information to the server providing the website. This request
information includes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>your current IP-Address over which you are connected to the internet</li>
<li>name and version of your browser software and operating system</li>
<li>website, from which you reached the requested website if using a hyperlink
(the so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer">referer-URL, it's misspelling originated in the original
proposal for the HTTP specification</a>)</li>
<li>date and time of the request</li>
</ul>

<p>
The request information is required by the server to process your request of
the website and is discarded as soon as this request is fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
Your privacy is very important to me. For this reason, I do not use any third
party services on my website, which would receive your request information. I
also do not set any cookies which would allow to track you navigating my
website. My website is only available over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>, the standard for encrypted
HTTP (called HTTPS), preventing other from seeing or changing the requested
sites (only the hostname, www.gfxpro.com, for the request is not encrypted,
which is a feature of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication">SNI extension</a> to TLS and allows the server to serve
more than one website over TLS).
</p>

<p>
When you contact me, I store the personal information which is provided along
with your message to me. I keep this data as long as necessary for our
conversation and as required by law (which is six years for business
correspondence in germany). Conversations over e-mail are not encrypted by
default and you should use PGP to encrypt e-mails. You can find <a href="https://keybase.io/skoschnicke">my PGP-key at
keybase.io</a>.
</p>

<p>
When I work for you, I store your contact data in my invoice system, which is
called <a href="https://www.getharvest.com/privacy-policy">Harvest</a> and is operated by Iridesco, LLC d/b/a Harvest, a New York
(USA) limited liability company. Harvest is fully GDPR compliant (<a href="https://www.getharvest.com/privacy-policy">see
Harvest's privacy policy</a>). Invoices are stored ten years as required by german
law.
</p>

<p>
Additionally to normal bank transfer you can pay me using PayPal and Stripe.
When using one of these third party services, the service receives your
payment data. You can consult the <a href="https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-prev">PayPal privacy policy</a> and the <a href="https://stripe.com/de/privacy">Stripe privacy
policy</a> for further details.
</p>

<p>
  In any case, I follow industry standards of technical, physical and
  administrative security to safeguard your personal information.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to access or change your personal data that I store, you may
  <a href="https://www.gfxpro.com/about">contact me</a>. You have the right to disclosure, correction, deletion or
  constraint of your personal data, if permitted by law.
</p>

<p>
  If you are unhappy about how I handle your personal data, you may complain to
  any data privacy authority. For example the to the <a href="https://www.datenschutzzentrum.de/">Independent Centre for
  Privacy Protection Schleswig-Holstein</a>.
