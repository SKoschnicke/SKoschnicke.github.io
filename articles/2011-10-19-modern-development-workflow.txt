title: "Modern development workflow"

Developing high-quality software in little time is hard when you are a single
developer, but it gets even harder when you are a group of developers working
on the same project. Technology can enable us to work better together without
forcing everyone into tight regulations on how, when and where they do their
work.

Of course, without some rules about the workflow, structured collaboration is
unlikely to happen, so there needs to be some rules, but they should not
get into the way of the real work. I will describe a workflow that does just
that by using modern technologies to support developers at every possible
degree.


Tools:
- Git
- GitHub
  - Wiki
  - Pull requests
- Flowdock
- Quassum

Vorteile:
- Asynchronitaet
- Standortunabhaengigkeit
- Wissenstransfer (durch die Pull-Requests)
- Skaliert (GitHub benutzt es mit [to_research] Mitarbeitern)
